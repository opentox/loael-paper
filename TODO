  variability from paolos paper
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square_deviation
  When the RMSD is normalized by the mean measured value, is usually called coefficient of variation of the RMSD, CV(RMSD). It is analogous to the coefficient of variation with the RMSD taking the place of the standard deviation.
